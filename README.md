A form to allow you to submit songs to a music database

Finished the assignment. Did a little bit of form validation (if they leave song or artist blank, it won't submit the song and will give them an error message).  Used the bootstrap-select library to give nice select boxes that even have filtering when you type.  Got a little hacky with the CSS to get them to look good though.
